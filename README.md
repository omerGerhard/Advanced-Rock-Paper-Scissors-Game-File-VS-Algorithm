# Advanced-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-File-VS-Algorithm

It is a game for 2 players, in which there are two options for each player to play with:
1. Two files containing the starting positions for the tools and all the movements of them for the entire game, pre-game.
2. Play with an automatic randomised algorithm written by me.

In case the player chooses to use files, in any case of a problem with a tool movement command, the player looses immediately.
